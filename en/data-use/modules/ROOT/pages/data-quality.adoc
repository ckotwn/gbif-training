= Handling Data Quality

Filtering the data allows you as a user to obtain the data that is most fit for purpose. 
All searches have a set of filters that can be used for finding the data you need, and occurrence searches have a set of additional 'Advanced" search filters for users that need to do more advanced filtering.  
While filters may allow you to filter out data that may not be relevant, or be of lower quality for your purposes, additional filtering may be required either manually or programmaticially to deal with additional data quality issues that arise during the GBIF data publishing model.  
Below are some common data filters that you as a user might consider to make the data more fit-for-purpose. 

== Geospatial Filters & Issues

The data can be filtered spatially in an occurrrence search in one of 3 ways:

* Country or area/Continent - data is filtered by country and will include data within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
* Administrative area - this filter uses the GADM database https://gadm.org/data.html of administrative areas for all countries in the world to allow for 
GBIF removes common geospatial issues by default if you choose to have data with a location.
* Location - this filter allows you to filter for data with coordinates and/or draw your own polygon shape filters or use a GeoJSON file to delimit your own shape filter. 
If you filter for those data with coordinates, a number of geospatial issues associated with the data publishing workflow will be eliminated. 
These are:

** Zero Coordinates- Coordinates are exactly (0,0) or what is sometimes called "null island". 
Zero-zero coordinate is a very common geospatial issue. GBIF removes (0,0) when hasgeospatialissue is set to FALSE.  
** Country coordinate mis-match - Data publishers will often supply GBIF with a country code (US,TW,SE,JP…). 
GBIF uses the two letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 coding system - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2. 
When a point does not fall within the country’s polygon or EEZ, but says that it should occur within the country, it gets flagged as having “country coordinate mis-match” and will be removed if data are filtered for locations.
** Coordinate invalid - If GBIF is unable to interpret the coordinates i.e. the coordinates.
** Coordinate invalid - The coordinates are outside of the range for decimal lat/lon values ((-90,90), (-180,180)).

== Country centroids

Country centroids are where the observation is pinned to the centre of the country instead of where the taxon was observed or recorded.
Country centroids are usually records that have been retrospectively given a lat-lon value based on a textual description of where the original record was located. 
Geocoding software uses gazetteers, geographical dictionaries or directories used in conjunction with a map or atlas, to attribute coordinates to place names. 
So, if the record simply says “Brazil”, some publishers will put the record in the center of Brazil. 
Similarly if the record simply says “Texas” or “Paris” the record will go in the center of those regions. 
This is almost exclusively a feature of museum data (PRESERVED_SPECIMEN), but it can also happen with other types of records as well.  

Identifying country centroid data is currently not possible using GBIF filters, however, the R package CoordinateCleaner can be used for identifying and filtering for country centroids.

== Points along the equator or prime meridian

Some publishers consider zero and NULL to be equivalent so that empty latitude and longitude fields for a record are given a zero value.
As a result, records end up being plotted along the equator and prime meridian lines.

== Uncertain location 

Often you will want to be sure that the coordinates give a certain location and are not really 1000s of km away from where the organism was observed or collected. 
There are two fields - coordinate precision and coordinateUncertaintyInMeters - in Darwin Core that you get with a SIMPLE CSV download. that you can use to filter by “uncertainty”.  
However, these fields are not used very often by publishers who feel that their records are fairly certain (from a GPS) and we would recommend not filtering out missing values. 

There are also a few “fake” values for coordinate uncertainty that you should be aware of. 
These values are errors produced by geocoding software and do not represent real uncertainty values. 
These "fake" values are 301, 3036, 999 and 9999.  
In the case of the value 301, the uncertainty is often much-much greater than 301 and actually represents a country centroid.

== Gridded datasets
Gridded datasets are a known problem at GBIF. 
Many datasets have equally-spaced points in a regular pattern. 
These datasets are usually systematic national surveys or data taken from some atlas (“so-called rasterized collection designs”).
Georeferenced occurrences are snapped to a central point

Most publishers of gridded datasets actually fill in one of the following columns: coordinateuncertaintyinmeters, coordinateprecision, footprintwkt
So filtering by these columns can be a good way to remove gridded datasets.
The R package Coordinate cleaner also has a function for removing gridded datasets.
GBIF has an experimental API for identifying datasets which exhibit a certain about of "griddyness". You can read more here: https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/finding-gridded-datasets/

== Absence records

By default, both presence and absence records are shown when you search www.gbif.org. 
Absence records confirm that a species was not found at a specific locality when that area was surveyed and this information can be useful in, for example, developing ecological niche models. 
However, you may only be interested in presence records and in this instance you can filter for only presence records using the Occurrence Status filter. 

== Establishment Means

The Darwin Core term establishmentMeans identifies the process by which the biological individual(s) represented in the Occurrence became established at the location. 
As such, it can serve as a useful filtering tool for identifying records that are outside of a species native range with accepted terms for this field being native, nativeReintroduced, introduced, introducedAssistedColonisation, vagrant and uncertain.  
Currently, GBIF records can be searched using the older vocabulary terms native, introduced, naturalized, native, managed and uncertain -   https://rs.gbif.org/vocabulary/gbif/establishment_means.xml, and these will be updated in late 2022. 
In some instances, removing “MANAGED” records will remove zoo records.

Use this filter cautiously, however, as most records do not contain this information and so would be exluded from a search with this filter on.
We would recommend to use the information within the Establishement Means term for filtering after download. 

== Basis of Record 

Basis of record is a Darwin Core term that refers to the specific nature of the record and can refer to one of 6 classes:

* Living Specimen - a specimen that is alive, for example, a living plant in a botanical garden or a living animal in a zoo.  
* Preserved Specimen - a speciment that has been preserved, for example, a plant on an herbarium shett or a cataloged lot of fish in a jar.
* Fossil Specimen - a preserved specimen that is a fossil, for example, a body fossil, a coprolite, a gastrolith, an ichnofossil or a piece of petrified tree.
* Material Citation - A reference to, or citation of, one, a part of, or multiple specimens in scholarly publications, for example, a citation of a physical specimen from a scientifci collection in taxonomic treatment in a scientiufic publication or an occurrence mentioned in a field note book.  
* Human Observation - an output of human observation process eg. evidence of an occurrence taken from field notes or literature or a records of an occurence without physical evidence nor evidence captured with a machine.  
* Machine Observation - An output of a machine observation process for example a photograph, a video, an audio recording, a remote sensing image or an occurrence record based on telemetry.  

Basis or record should allow users to filter out those indidivuals in ex-situ collections such as zoos and botanic gardens or fossils as well as filter for those records based on whether the record is based on a specimen or an observation, which can support taxonomic validation.  
You should note that, even though this can be a useful filter, data publishers do not always fill the basis of record field correctly, or, there may be nuances in the data that may not be immediately obvious to a user e.g. https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/living-specimen-to-preserved-specimen-understanding-basis-of-record/ and you should always double check your data before use.

== Old Records

GBIF has many museum records that might be older than what is desired for some studies.

== Duplicates

Duplication of records can occur when several records of the same individal are made. 
This can occur from for instance, a researcher depositing several specimens from an individual tree in herbaria around the world who all then publish these data on GBIF, or when an individual has been deposited in a natural history collection and the indidivual was also sampled for its DNA.  
In this instance, there will be a record for the specimen in the collections and one for the DNA sequence. 

GBIF has recently introduces a clustering function in its advanced search that allows users to identify clusters of records i.e. records that appear to be derived from the same source.  
This allows users to identify potential duplicated data and filter for these out of your download.  
Note that if you filter out those records that are in a cluster, you will lose all records found within that cluster and will lose potentially useful data. 
The filter may be better used to indicate the extent to which there is duplication in the dataset, or for indepedent donwloads of the clustered and non-clustered datasets for comparison.
