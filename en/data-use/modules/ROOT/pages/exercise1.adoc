= Exercise 1

[NOTE.activity]
For this activity, you will will begin to work with https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/[Darwin Core terms^] to determine which terms might be relevant for your use.

Imagine you are about to assess a species, perhaps choose a species that you are familiar with.  Determine which of the listed Darwin Core terms might be more relevant than others in assessing the extinction risk of a species and what might be some of the data quality issues associated with those terms. Remember that information for a red list assessment can be observed, estimated, inferred, projected and suspected.

. Download the exercise sheet and use it to record your thoughts: link:../exercise-data/UC1-2-occurrence-template.xlsx[UC1-2-occurrence-template.xlsx,opts=download] (156 KB).

TIP: You find other relevant terms to add to your list beyond the ones provided on the exercise sheet.
