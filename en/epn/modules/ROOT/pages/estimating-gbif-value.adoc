= Estimating the value of GBIF

This section will help you to understand the value of GBIF as data infrastructure and an international network. Estimates of the economic value of GBIF can be helpful in communicating the benefits of Participation in the network.

== Economic valuation

The 2023 report, Economic valuation and assessment of the impact of the GBIF network, prepared and published by Deloitte Access Economics, gives insight into the value that GBIF provides to its users and in broader societal benefits.

Having watched the video above, work through the following steps to estimate the national value of time savings from GBIF-enabled research. Do this for your own country and keep notes of your findings in your activity sheet. You can also do this for other countries to give some comparisons.
====

*Step 1*: Go to the https://www.gbif.org/[GBIF website] and click on the icon showing the global number of peer-reviewed papers using data.

&nbsp;

*Step 2*:  You are now looking at literature filtered by “Literature type” = “Journal article” and “Relevance” = “GBIF used”. This means you are seeing a list of all tracked examples of journal articles that cite the use of GBIF-mediated data.

&nbsp;

*Step 3*: Using the filter “Country or area of researcher”, filter these results to your own country. You are now seeing all tracked examples of journal articles that cite the use of GBIF-mediated data for 
which at least one of the authors is affiliated with an institution from your country.

&nbsp;

*Step 4*: Using the filter “Year of publication”, filter the results to only show publications from one full year. You are now seeing all tracked examples of journal articles that cite the use of GBIF-mediated data for which at least one of the authors is affiliated with an institution from your country from a single year. Enter this value into the column in your activity sheet.

&nbsp;

*Step 5*: Estimate the hourly wage for a researcher or data scientist in your country. Keep note of this value and the currency in your activity sheet.

*Step 6*: Apply the formula explained in the video to calculate the estimated value of research time saved by GBIF for the year and keep note of the result in your activity sheet.

*Step 7*: Consider what this figure means and how it could be used to communicate the value of GBIF Participation.
