= Understanding GBIF's value

The starting point for building a case for a country or international organization to formally participate in GBIF is to understand the value of GBIF as data infrastructure and an international network. 
In this section, we explore GBIFâ€™s value and relevance through reports and videos guiding you to consider how best to communicate the benefits GBIF brings to its participants.

== Economic valuation

The 2023 report, Economic valuation and assessment of the impact of the GBIF network, prepared and published by Deloitte Access Economics, gives insight into the value that GBIF provides to its users and in broader societal benefits.
