= Engaging stakeholders towards establishing a node

[NOTE.objectives]
====
In this section, you will:

* use the xref:use-case-darwinia.adoc[use case scenario] for the fictitious country of Darwinia as the context for the exercises, but we encourage you to consider at each step how this applies to your own national or organizational context.
* explore through *three practical exercises* how you can get involved in engaging stakeholders to make the case for formal GBIF Participation and for the establishment of a new node. 

Remember that discussing your approach to these exercises with your peers and mentors will help you to refine your ideas and strengthen your case. The GBIF nodes work together as a community, recognizing the importance of collaboration and learning from others' experiences to develop the capacity of GBIF as a whole.
