= Process for becoming a GBIF Participant

In this section, we will review the details of how to become a member of GBIF, the description of Participant categories, and the GBIF Memorandum of Understanding. 
We will investigate recent examples of new GBIF Participants to better understand their pathway to formal engagement in the GBIF network. 

TIP: Before going further, go back and review the https://docs.gbif.org/course-introduction-to-gbif/en/introduction-to-gbif-participant-nodes.html[Introduction to GBIF Participant nodes section^] of the pre-requisite course, in which we discussed the modes of formal Participation in GBIF as an intergovernmental network and research infrastructure.
