= Benefits of establishing a node

Establishing a node is one of the key commitments that Participants make in joining GBIF. 
It is important to understand the roles that nodes play within GBIF, as well as the benefits that nodes provide on the national level.

=== Node services

Nodes typically provide services in four key areas:

. *Support for science and research*, contributing to improving biodiversity evidence for scientific research and understanding
. *Support for policy and decisions*, contributing to developing partnerships that benefit policy and society
. *Engaging and enabling the community*, contributing to developing the GBIF network to meet future needs and challenges
. *Technical services for biodiversity data management*, contributing to maintaining and evolving infrastructure to advance biodiversity-related knowledge

There are often existing institutions and networks within a country at the time of joining GBIF that already provide at least some of these services. 
Understanding this landscape can help in deciding where to position a new node, and what its priorities should be. 
The coordination role is often especially important.

[NOTE.activity]
====
After reading more about the services that nodes provide, consider if any of these services are already provided by institutions or networks within your country or organization, and which you would consider to be gaps. 
Keep note of this in your activity sheet.
