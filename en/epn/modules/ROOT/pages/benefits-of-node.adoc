= Benefits of establishing a node

Establishing a node is one of the key commitments that Participants make in joining GBIF. 
It is important to understand the roles that nodes play within GBIF, as well as the benefits that nodes provide on the national level.

== Node services

Nodes typically provide services in four key areas:

. Services relating to coordinating the landscape of biodiversity-related initiatives including participating in the GBIF network
. Services relating to supporting biodiversity data mobilization
. Services relating to supporting biodiversity data analysis and use
. Services relating to biodiversity data management and curation

There are often existing institutions and networks within a country at the time of joining GBIF that already provide at least some of these services. 
Understanding this landscape can help in deciding where to position a new node, and what its priorities should be. 
The coordination role is often especially important.

After reading more about the services that nodes provide, consider if any of these services are already provided by institutions or networks within your country or organization, and which you would consider to be gaps. 
Keep note of this in your activity sheet.
