= Prioritizing stakeholders

== Exercise 1

TIP: This exercise is based on the <<use-case,use case scenario>> for the fictitious country of Darwinia.  
Please refer to the context provided in the use case scenario when providing your answers in the link:../course-docs/B-Exercise-1-Exercise-sheet-EN.docx[exercise sheet]. 

One way to guide the thought process around prioritizing who to engage in building a case for GBIF Participation is to map the stakeholders onto a matrix that looks at:

. How likely each stakeholder is to support the desired outcome (in this case, the country becoming a GBIF Participant and establishing a node)
. How much influence each stakeholder is likely to have on the outcome (remembering that for a country to join, signature of the MOU may come from a minister or senior official in a relevant government department or designated national agency)

====
In your exercise sheet, referring to the use case scenario, identify all the stakeholders to engage in making a case for GBIF Participation and map them onto the prioritization matrix. Keep track of your rationale for where you have placed the stakeholders, and any points you would wish to discuss with your peers.
