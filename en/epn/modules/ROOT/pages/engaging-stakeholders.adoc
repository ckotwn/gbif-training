= Engaging stakeholders

When building a case for a country to join GBIF, it is important to start by identifying all the stakeholders (actors and parties) that would be concerned with GBIF Participation, and then considering which of these will be most helpful. 

== Key audiences

GBIFâ€™s communication strategy is a helpful resource in identifying the key audiences and messages to communicate to them to build engagement. 
It can also help you consider the stakeholder groups to engage when building a case for GBIF participation within your country or network.
